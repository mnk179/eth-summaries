# Communication Networks

This course covered the fundamental concepts of communication networks and internet-based communications. Specifically:

* how the Internet works;
* build and operate Internet-like network infrastructures;
* identify the right set of metrics to evaluate the performance or the adequacy of a network and propose ways to improve it (if any).

The course introduced the relevant mechanisms used in today's networks both from an abstract perspective but also from a practical one by presenting many real-world examples and through multiple hands-on projects.
