# eth summaries

This is a collection of lecture summaries that I wrote during the course of my bachelor and master studies in electrical engineering and information technology at ETH Zurich.

## Communication Systems

This course that gives a broad overview over the lower two layers of the OSI stack. Subjects treated were random processes, baseband and passband signal transmission, information theory, data link layer and multiple access.

## Discrete Event Systems

This course gives an introduction to discrete event systems. The course is split into three parts. In the first parts, the limits of computation were explored. The threee distinct models finite automata, push-down automata and Turing machines were discussed. In the second part of the course, discrete event systems were examined from an average-case perspective: modeling discrete events as stochastic processes, and then applying continuous time markov chains and queueing theory for an understanding of the typical behavior of a system. Then, discrete event systems were analyzed from a worst-case perspective using the theory of online algorithms and adversarial queueing. In the last part of the course, methods that allow to formally verify certain properties of Finite Automata and Petri Nets were introduced.
