Semester: Fall semester 2017

Lecturer: Prof. Armin Wittneben

## Summary

Introduction into the fundamentals of digital communication systems. Selected examples on the application of the fundamental principles in existing and upcoming communication systems.

Covered are the lower three layer of the OSI reference model: the physical, the data link, and the network layer. The basic terms of information theory are introduced. After this, we focus on the methods for the point to point communication, which may be addressed elegantly and coherently in the signal space. Methods for error detection and correction as well as protocols for the retransmission of perturbed data will be covered. Also the medium access for systems with shared medium will be discussed. Finally, algorithms for routing and flow control will be treated.

The application of the basic methods will be extensively explained using existing and future wireless and wired systems.
