# Advanced Topics in Communication Networks

Semester: Fall semester 2019

Lecturer: Prof. Laurent Vanbever

## Summary

This class introduces students to advanced, research-level topics in the area of communication networks, both theoretically and practically.

During the Fall Semester of 2019, the class focuses on programmable network data planes and involves developing network applications on top of the latest generation of programmable network hardware. By leveraging data-plane programmability, these applications can build deep traffic insights to, for instance, detect traffic anomalies (e.g. using Machine Learning), flexibly adapt forwarding behaviors (to improve performance), speed-up distributed applications (e.g. Map Reduce), or track network-wide health. More importantly, all this can now be done at line-rate, at forwarding speeds that can reach Terabits per second.
