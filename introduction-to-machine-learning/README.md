# Introduction to Machine Learning

Semester: Spring semester 2018

Lecturer: Prof. Andreas Krause

## Summary

This course covered the foundations of learning and making predictions from data. Concepts such as trading goodness of fit and model complexity are studied and important machine learning algorithms were discussed.

The full content of the lecture is:

* Linear regression (overfitting, cross-validation/bootstrap, model selection, regularization, [stochastic] gradient descent)
* Linear classification: Logistic regression (feature selection, sparsity, multi-class)
* Kernels and the kernel trick (Properties of kernels, applications to linear and logistic regression), k-nearest neighbor
* Neural networks (backpropagation, regularization, convolutional neural networks)
* Unsupervised learning (k-means, PCA, neural network autoencoders)
* The statistical perspective (regularization as prior, loss as likelihood, learning as MAP inference)
* Statistical decision theory (decision making based on statistical models and utility functions)
* Discriminative vs. generative modeling (benefits and challenges in modeling joint conditional distributions)
* Bayes' classifiers (Naive Bayes, Gaussian Bayes, MLE)
* Bayesian approaches to unsupervised learning (Gaussian mixtures, EM)
